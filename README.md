# LoanClassifier 
This is my first personal and public data science project I've done. This is a well known public dataset, where each data point represents a request for a loan along with useful information regarding the person requesting the loan. For the most part I followed a template on AnalyticsVidhya to help me organize everything. All code is mine. I did some very basic data cleaning, EDA and visualization, and feature engineering where I ran a couple different models comparing the perforamnces beforre and after data cleaning and feature engineering.
